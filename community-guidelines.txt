The intent of this document is to clarify what we consider to be acceptable
use of Tumblr.

If you are found to be in violation of any of the below policies, you will
receive a notice via email. Unless you explain or correct your behavior
within 72 hours, your account will be suspended. We will do our best to
work with you and ensure a fair outcome in all cases. We reserve the right
to immediately suspend, without notice, any content, account, or IP address
which we determine to be systematically generated, spam, or potentially
damaging to our service or infrastructure.

When your account is suspended, public access to your content is blocked,
and your Tumblr URL (and custom domain if applicable) is redirected to the
Tumblr home page. Access to your Tumblr Dashboard and the ability to
add/edit posts is also disabled.

• REDUNDANT CONTENT. Tumblr is not intended to be an all-purpose content
  aggregator. Users who import or aggregate content in a less-than-meaningful
  way are likely to be suspended.

• ILLEGAL USE. Tumblr may not be used for illegal purposes. Examples of this
  include using Tumblr for fraudulent purposes or operating a phishing site
  (used to obtain account and password information).

• SPAM. Users that do not publish meaningful content, use deceptive means to
  generate revenue or traffic, or whose primary purpose is affiliate
  marketing, will be suspended.

• IDENTITY THEFT AND PRIVACY. Users that misleadingly appropriate the
  identity of another person are not permitted. Users may not post other
  people's personally identifying or confidential information, including but
  not limited to credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and driver's
  and other license numbers. You may not post information such as other
  people's passwords, usernames, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail
  addresses unless already publicly accessible on the Web.

• HATE CONTENT, DEFAMATION, AND LIBEL. Hate speech and other objectionable
  content that is unlawful, defamatory, and fraudulent. Note that an
  allegation of defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish
  defamation. The truth or falsehood of a bit of expression is a key element
  in establishing defamation, and we are not in a position to make that sort
  of fact-based judgment. That said, if we have reason to believe that a
  particular statement is defamatory (a court order, for example), we will
  remove that statement.

• DISRUPTIONS AND EXPLOITS. We will terminate accounts and block addresses of
  those who attempt unauthorized use of Tumblr.com.

• COPYRIGHT. Using copyrighted material does not constitute infringement in
  all cases. In general, however, users should be careful when using
  copyrighted content without the permission of those who created it. It is
  our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with
  the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").

• MASS REGISTRATION AND AUTOMATION. Accounts that are registered
  automatically or systematically will be removed and access will be
  permanently suspended.

• SEXUALLY EXPLICIT VIDEO. Accounts that use Tumblr's Video Upload feature to
  regularly upload and host sexually explicit or pornographic material will
  be suspended.
