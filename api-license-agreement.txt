This Application Developer and API License Agreement (the "Agreement"),
effective as of the date of acceptance of this Agreement
(the "Effective Date"), is by and between Tumblr, Inc. ("Tumblr") and you, or
the individual, company or other entity that you represent ("Licensee"). If you
are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other entity, you
represent and warrant that you have authority to bind such company or other
entity to this Agreement.

By building applications on Tumblr's platform, particularly those using the
Tumblr API, you agree to this contract.

By building applications that interact with Tumblr's products and services (the
"Tumblr Services") or using the Tumblr API, including but not limited to
requesting authentication credentials or making calls to the Tumblr API,
Licensee unconditionally consents and agrees to be bound by and a party to this
Agreement.

This Agreement sets forth the rules around use of the Tumblr Services, the
Tumblr API, and content shared on Tumblr that is accessible (through the Tumblr
API or otherwise) for application development. Our hope is to encourage a
thriving ecosystem of applications built on top of Tumblr, balanced against
protection of our network, our bloggers and our business. If you feel that we
should make changes to this Agreement, or if you seek a waiver from certain
provisions herein, please contact us at [api@tumblr.com].

  1. Purpose.

    a. Use of Licensed Materials. This Agreement governs the use by Licensee of
       the following, all of which collectively are the "Licensed Materials":
       (a) the application programming interface ("API") of Tumblr and any
       accompanying or related documentation, source code, executable
       applications and other materials (collectively, the "Tumblr API"), including, but not
       limited to, as made available through [Tumblr's developer website] (the
       "Developer Website"), as modified from time to time; (b) information
       related to blogs and websites hosted by Tumblr (the "Blogs"); (c) individual
       posts made on Tumblr Blogs (the "Posts"); (d) Tumblr user profile information
       ("Tumblr User Information"); and (e) any other content
       made available through the Tumblr API, including but not limited to
       private messages sent and/or received by Tumblr users and native
       Tumblr actions such as Tumblr reblogs, replies and likes
       (collectively with the Blogs, the Posts and Tumblr User
       Information, the "Content").

    b. Use of Tumblr Marks. This Agreement also governs the use by
       Licensee, and restrictions on such use, of Tumblr's name,
       trademarks, service marks, logos and other branding made available
       for use in connection with the Licensed Materials (the
       "Tumblr Marks").

  2. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
     the restrictions set forth in Section 3, Tumblr grants to Licensee a
     nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, worldwide, revocable
     right and license during the Term to: (a) use and make calls to the
     Tumblr API and to make use of the Tumblr Services (and Licensed Materials
     accessible therefrom) to develop, implement and distribute software
     applications, services or products (the "Licensee
     Applications") that interact with the Tumblr Services; (b) use,
     reproduce, distribute, transmit, display and perform the Content, and
     modify (i.e., alter in any manner) the Content only to the extent
     necessary to format and display it through the Licensee Applications and
     (c) use and display the Tumblr Marks only to identify that the Licensed
     Materials originate from the Tumblr Services. Licensed Applications do
     not include those applications that use or access the Tumblr API or the
     Tumblr Services in order to monitor the availability, performance, or
     functionality of any of the Tumblr API or the Tumblr Services, for any
     other benchmarking or for other competitive purposes.

     As part of allowing applications to be built on and connected to Tumblr's
     products andservices, whether or not using the Tumblr API, we give you
     access to a bunch of tools, including the API itself, the developer
     documents and content posted to Tumblr blogs. This license gives you the
     right to use those materials to make apps of all kinds, and also gives you
     the right to use Tumblr's trademarks to identify that the apps that are
     built on top of Tumblr's products and services.

  3. Restrictions. The licenses granted in Section 2 are explicitly
     conditioned on Licensee's adherence to the following
     restrictions.

     There are a few things you aren't allowed to do as a Tumblr application
     developer...

     a. Compliance with this Agreement, Policies and Guidelines. Licensee
        must comply with the restrictions set forth in this Agreement, the
        Tumblr Terms of Service], the [Tumblr Privacy Policy], the [Tumblr
        Trademark Guidelines] and the [Tumblr Content Policy] in all uses of
        the Licensed Materials. If Tumblr believes, in its sole discretion,
        that Licensee has violated or attempted to violate any term,
        condition or the spirit of this Agreement, Licensee's license
        to and ability to use and access the Licensed Materials may be
        temporarily or permanently revoked, with or without notice to
        Licensee.

        Complying with these restrictions is really important. In particular,
        the spirit of the Agreement is clear, and if you find a strict loophole
        in the language, we may still revoke your API access. If you're
        concerned about whether or not your violating this Agreement, our Terms
        of Service, or any other policies or guidelines, please e-mail us at
        [legal@tumblr.com]

     b. Obtaining and Maintaining an API Key. In order to use the Tumblr
        API, Licensee must obtain API credentials (an "API
        Key") via registration on the Developer Website. Licensee
        shall not share his or her API Key, shall keep such API Key secure
        and shall use it as Licensee's sole means of accessing the
        Tumblr API.

     c. User Login via OAuth. Licensed Applications shall present users
        with the ability to log into the Tumblr Services through the Tumblr
        API via the OAuth protocol. Users without an account on the Tumblr
        Services shall be presented with an opportunity to create such an
        account.

     d. No Substantial Replication. Licensee shall not substantially
        replicate products or services offered by Tumblr, but is explicitly
        permitted to create specialized versions or extensions of such
        products or services. For example, Licensee is not permitted to
        fully replicate the Tumblr Dashboard product, but may create
        specialized views of Content from a user's Dashboard or
        cross-platform variants of the Tumblr Dashboard. In addition,
        Licensee shall not use the Licensed Materials or other information
        collected from users of Licensed Applications to create or maintain
        a separate blogging platform, social network or other social
        service.

        Don't re-implement complete Tumblr functions or clients on a platform
        where Tumblr already has an official client (web, iPhone, Android).

     e. No In-Stream Advertising; No In-Network Promotions. Licensee shall
        not, in any manner, display any form of advertising within a stream
        of Content received by a user of a Licensed Application. In
        addition, advertisements cannot replicate the look and feel of, or
        reasonably be confused by users as, a piece of Content and should
        be clearly separated from Content. In addition, Licensed
        Applications may not promote any Content to or within the Tumblr
        network ("In-Network Promotions"), including if payment
        is received for such In-Network Promotions. For example, Licensed
        Applications may not create ranking systems or directories for
        Tumblr blogs or posts and promote those rankings or directories
        within or outside of the Tumblr Services.

        Don't inject in-stream ads. Don't offer special placement or promotion
        to specific Tumblr blogs or content within your app, especially for
        money, and don't implement ranking systems.

     f. No Marketplaces or Other Aggregators or Repositories of Code or
        Applications. Licensee is not permitted to create any sort of
        marketplace or other aggregator or public repository of code or
        applications the purpose of which is to collect items substantially
        based on the Licensed Materials, including Licensed Applications (a
        "Marketplace"), regardless of whether or not such
        Marketplace charges for such items. Such Marketplaces include, but
        are not limited to, collections of Tumblr themes, collections of
        Tumblr extensions or plugins and non-general purpose collections
        comprised solely of Licensed Applications. In addition, Licensee
        should not participate in such prohibited Marketplaces.

        Tumblr should be the single point of origin for any apps, extensions, or
        code that we provide tools to aggregate. That includes blog themes and
        our official apps.

        This is a serious security and quality issue for our business and
        our bloggers. For example, themes not hosted in our [Theme Garden]
        have not been vetted and have historically been a significant
        vector for spam and identity theft. To be clear, you are otherwise
        allowed and encouraged to distribute your applications on general
        purpose app stores.

     g. No Export for the Purpose of Replication, Repackaging or Resale.
        Licensee shall not, under any circumstances, export Content to a
        datastore intended to replicate, in whole or in part,
        Tumblr's datastore, nor shall Licensee repackage and/or
        resell the Licensed Materials, including any Content, in any
        manner, including but not limited to by offering access to the
        Licensed Materials through its own API. For the sake of clarity,
        this restriction is not intended to apply to Licensed Applications
        that may, at the request of a user, export such user's
        Content for the purposes of data portability.

        You won't try to archive or resell Tumblr data, excluding data
        portability applications.

     h. No Compromising Tumblr Security. Licensee is not permitted to use
        the Licensed Materials in any manner that does or could potentially
        undermine the security of the Tumblr Services or the Licensed
        Materials. In addition, Licensee shall not, and shall not attempt
        to, interfere with, modify or disable any features, functionality
        or security controls of the Tumblr Services or the Tumblr API,
        defeat, avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate or otherwise circumvent
        any protection mechanisms for the Licensed Materials, or reverse
        engineer, decompile, disassemble or derive source code, underlying
        ideas, algorithms, structure or organizational form from the Tumblr
        Services or the Tumblr API.

     i. Reporting Security Flaws and Unauthorized Access. Licensee shall
        immediately report to Tumblr any security flaws Licensee discovers
        in any of the Tumblr Services or the Licensed Materials. Tumblr
        reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine what
        constitutes a security flaw. Licensee shall further immediately
        report any actual or suspected unauthorized access to the Tumblr
        API using Licensee's API credentials. Failure to report such
        flaws or unauthorized accesses, particularly prior to public
        disclosure, shall be considered a material breach of this
        Agreement.

        Be a good citizen: report suspected security issues to us before making
        them public. You can send security flaw reports to
        [security@tumblr.com].

    j. No Phishing, Malware or Identity Theft. Licensee shall not publish
       or link to malicious content intended to damage, disrupt or exploit
       a user's browser, computer or Tumblr account or to compromise
       a user's privacy or credentials in any manner. In addition,
       Licensee shall not collect, or try to collect, a user's
       Tumblr credentials, including but not limited to usernames or
       passwords.

    k. No Spamming. Licensee shall not use the Tumblr Services or Tumblr
       API, and shall not create Licensed Applications, for the purpose of
       "spamming." Tumblr reserves the right, in its sole
       discretion, to determine what actions constitute
       "spamming," such actions including but not limited to
       posting numerous substantially identical pieces of Content, posting
       misleading or obfuscated links and executing a large number of
       native Tumblr actions (e.g., posting, reblogging, liking,
       following) in a short period of time.

    l. Respect for API Limitations. Licensee shall respect the letter and
       the spirit of the programmatic limitations of the Tumblr API and
       the restrictions of this Agreement in designing and implementing
       Licensed Applications. For example, Licensee shall not work around
       any explicit Tumblr API limitation using a series of non-API calls,
       even if such work-arounds are possible by avoiding use of the
       Tumblr API. Specific prohibited actions include the process of
       "page scraping," which is the process of downloading
       and parsing whole Tumblr pages in order to build Licensee
       Applications with capabilities beyond those intended to be provided
       by the Tumblr API. In addition, Licensee shall comply with any
       limitations on the frequency of access, calls and use of the Tumblr
       API as provided to Licensee by Tumblr from time to time.

       We've put a tremendous amount of care into making Tumblr's API
       functional and flexible enough for any projects you'll throw at it, and
       while we add new features frequently, certain features and data are not
       yet available. We ask that you respect these limitations, as well as
       any rate limits that we may place on actions, which are designed to
       protect our systems.

    m. No Content Modifications. Tumblr delivers Content for use under
       this Agreement, including materials created by or otherwise
       originating from Tumblr and delivered as part of such Content
       ("Tumblr Content"). Licensee shall not make any
       modifications to any Content, other than to modify the formatting
       of such Content in order to display it in a manner appropriate for
       the pertinent Licensed Applications. For example, Licensed
       Applications should not highlight text within a Post and externally
       link that text. In addition, Licensee shall not remove, block or
       otherwise prevent delivery of any Tumblr Content, including but not
       limited to any promotional content such as the Tumblr Radar.

    n. No Circumvention or Reverse Engineering; Maintenance of Proprietary
       Notices. Licensee shall not, and shall not attempt to: (i)
       interfere with, modify or disable any features or functionality of
       the Tumblr Services or Tumblr API, including, without limitation,
       any mechanisms used to restrict or control the Tumblr Services or
       Tumblr API, such as anti-circumvention measures; (ii) translate,
       reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or derive source code,
       underlying ideas, algorithms, structure or organizational form from
       the Tumblr Services or the Licensed Materials; (iii) defeat, avoid,
       bypass, remove, deactivate or otherwise circumvent any protection
       mechanisms for the Tumblr Services or the Licensed Materials; or
       (iv) remove or modify any proprietary notices, attribution or marks
       from or delivered as part of the Tumblr Services or the Licensed
       Materials.

    o. Genuine Actions. Licensee shall not create Licensed Applications
       with capabilities that in any way that do not reflect explicit,
       genuine expressions of user intent and permission. For example,
       Licensee Applications should not automatically follow blogs, should
       not like, reblog or reply to Content that a user has not explicitly
       liked, reblogged or replied to, and should not generate Posts on a
       user's behalf without (1) a specific interaction informing a
       user that such user is making a Post to a particular blog and (2)
       an explicit action by such user evincing permission for making such
       Post (e.g., a Licensed Application should not automatically
       generate a Post indicating that a user has registered for such
       Licensed Application). In addition, a Licensed Application should
       not require a user to generate a Post as a prerequisite to using a
       Licensed Application or a feature of a Licensed Application.

       Make sure any actions triggered on Tumblr are what your users expect and
       intend. Don't automate user commands like "following", "liking" or
       "reblogging". Don't encourage insincere gestures like "follow trains".

    p. No Continuous Playback. Licensee shall not use the Tumblr Services
       or the Tumblr API in a manner that enables sequential, continuous
       and/or uninterrupted playback of any media content, including but
       not limited to video, audio and images.

       For performance reasons, at this time we can't allow apps that allow
       continuous playback of media without user input. We hope this will
       change soon.

    q. Indicating Use of the Tumblr Services and the Tumblr API. In a
       prominent location in all Licensed Applications, Licensee should,
       to the extent reasonable based on the nature of the Licensed
       Application, indicate that such Licensed Applications have been
       created using the Tumblr Services and/or the Tumblr API, and shall
       comply with the [Tumblr Trademark Guidelines] in doing so.

       Make sure to say somewhere in your application that you're using the
       Tumblr Services or the Tumblr API.

       For example, you could say "Powered by Tumblr".

    r. Use of Tumblr Marks. Licensee may not, under any circumstances: (i)
       include in or use the Tumblr Marks, or any marks that are
       confusingly similar to or derivative of the Tumblr Marks (including
       without limitation, "TUMBL", "TUMBLOG",
       "TUM" and "BLR") ("Confusing Marks"), as part of Licensee's trade
       name (registered or otherwise), logos or other identifiers of
       Licensee; (ii) include in or use the Tumblr Marks or any Confusing
       Marks as part of any names, domain names logos or other identifiers
       of Licensee Applications; or (iii) use the Tumblr Marks or Confusing
       Marks in a manner that creates or may create a sense of endorsement,
       sponsorship or association with Tumblr, unless expressly permitted
       by Tumblr, in writing, to do so. All use of the Tumblr Marks, and
       any goodwill arising out of such use, shall inure to the benefit of
       Tumblr. Licensee may freely state and disclose that Licensee is
       using the Tumblr Services or the Tumblr API, as long as License
       adheres to all restrictions on the use of the Tumblr Marks stated
       in this Agreement, including those stated in the Tumblr_Trademark
       Guidelines.

       You have a responsibility to make sure users know your app was not
       built or endorsed by Tumblr.

    s. No Misleading Users. Licensee may not, under any circumstances,
       whether within a Licensed Application or in materials discussing or
       concerning a Licensed Application, mislead, confuse or cause
       misapprehension or confusion among users as to the features,
       functionality, origin, capabilities or other aspects of said
       Licensed Application, Tumblr, the Tumblr Services or the Tumblr
       API.

       You should not advertise or otherwise discuss your application in a way
       that confuses or misleads users about the application or about Tumblr.

    t. Monitoring. Tumblr reserves the right to monitor Licensee's
       use of the Licensed Materials for any reason or no reason,
       including to ensure Licensee's compliance with the terms and
       conditions of this Agreement.

    u. Reporting and Statistics. Licensee shall ensure that all Licensee
       Applications properly use all reporting functionality that is made
       available through aspects of the Tumblr API that are used by such
       Licensee Applications.

       When you register an application or report other data to us, you'll
       make an effort to ensure that that information is accurate.

    v. Attribution. Licensee agrees to maintain attribution of all pieces
       of Content to (1) the Tumblr blog that posted such Content (the
       "Posting Blog") and (2) the source of the Content, if such source was
       provided by the posting blog using the "Source" attribute (the "Source").
       At no time will Licensee falsely endorse Content obtained through the
       Tumblr Services or the Tumblr API as his/her/its own, unless
       Licensee has obtained the appropriate permissions of the applicable
       Posting Blog and/or Source. For the sake of clarity, this means
       that Licensee shall not display any Content without attribution to
       the Posting Blog and Source (if available), as delivered by the
       Tumblr Services or the Tumblr API. In addition, Licensee and
       Licensed Applications shall not modify or remove any proprietary
       notices, attribution or marks from the Licensed Materials.

       Attribution is really important for bloggers and content creators.
       You should make sure blog posts properly attribute both the posting
       blog and the origin source (when available).

  4. Modifications. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Tumblr may modify
     (including but not limited to updating) this Agreement, the Tumblr
     Services, the Tumblr API and [Tumblr Content Policy] from time to time (a
     "Modification"). Except for modifications of the Tumblr
     Services, Licensee will be notified a Modification through notifications
     or posts on the [Developer Website] or through a form of direct
     communication from Tumblr to Licensee, including but not limited to e-
     mail or notifications through the Tumblr Services. Licensee further
     acknowledges and agrees that the Tumblr Services and the Licensed
     Materials may be modified at any time and without any notice to Licensee.
     Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from the date of first notice of
     any Modification(s) (or such shorter period of time specified in the
     notice of the Modification(s)) comply with such modification(s) by
     implementing and using the most current version of the Tumblr API and
     making any changes to Licensee Applications that may be required as a
     result of such Modification(s). Licensee acknowledges that a Modification
     may have an adverse effect on Licensee Applications, including but not
     limited to changing the manner in which Licensee Applications communicate
     with Tumblr Services and display Content. Licensee acknowledges that its
     sole recourse for such adverse effects is to terminate this Agreement
     pursuant to Section 10, and that Licensee's continued access to or
     use of the Tumblr Services or any Licensed Materials following such
     thirty (30) day period shall constitute binding acceptance of the
     Modification(s) at issue. Tumblr will attempt, but is not obligated, to
     provide thirty (30) days notice of any Modification that is not backwards
     compatible or that Tumblr reasonably believes will remove or materially
     alter significant functionality of the Tumblr API.

     We reserve the right to modify the Tumblr Services, the Tumblr API and this
     Agreement. We'll give you as much notice as we can, but you need to comply
     with the modifications within 30 days or your access to the Tumblr
     Services or the Tumblr API may be revoked.

  5. Ownership.

     Tumblr and/or its users own and have all rights to everything
     except your application; you own and have all rights to your application
     excluding all of the other stuff.

     a. Tumblr. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Tumblr and its
        licensors, particularly its users, retain all worldwide right,
        title and interest in and to the Licensed Materials, including all
        worldwide intellectual property rights therein. Licensee also
        acknowledges and agrees that, as between Licensee and Tumblr,
        Tumblr owns all right, title and interest in and to the Tumblr
        Services, the Tumblr API, the Tumblr Marks, and any derivative
        works or enhancements thereof, including but not limited to all
        worldwide intellectual property rights therein. Licensee agrees not
        to act in any manner inconsistent with such ownership. Any of
        Tumblr's rights not expressly granted under this Agreement
        are withheld. Licensee agrees that it will not challenge
        Tumblr's ownership of the Tumblr Marks, challenge the
        validity of the licenses granted under this Agreement, or otherwise
        copy or exploit the Tumblr Marks during or after the termination of
        this Agreement, except as expressly authorized under this
        Agreement. If Licensee acquires any rights in the Tumblr Marks or
        any confusingly similar marks, by operation of law or otherwise,
        Licensee will, at no expense to Tumblr, immediately effectuate an
        assignment of such rights to Tumblr.

     b. Licensee. As between Licensee and Tumblr, Licensee retains all
        worldwide right, title and interest in and to the Licensee
        Applications, excluding the Tumblr Services, the Licensed
        Materials, the Tumblr Marks, and any derivative works or
        enhancements thereof, including but not limited to all intellectual
        property rights therein.

     c. Feedback. Licensee may provide Tumblr with feedback or comments
        related to the Licensed Material and/or Licensee's experience
        with and use thereof ("Feedback"). Licensee agrees that
        Tumblr and its designees and assigns shall be free to copy, modify,
        create derivative works of, publicly display, disclose, distribute,
        license, sublicense, incorporate and otherwise use Feedback,
        including all derivative works thereto, for any and all purposes,
        commercial or otherwise, with no obligation of any kind to
        Licensee.

  6. Support.

    a. This Agreement does not entitle Licensee to any support for the
       Licensed Materials, unless Licensee makes separate arrangements with
       Tumblr for such support. Any such support provided by Tumblr shall be
       subject to the terms of this Agreement as modified by a separate support
       agreement. Licensee is solely responsible for providing all support and
       technical assistance to end users of the Licensee Applications. Licensee
       acknowledges and agrees that Tumblr has no obligation to provide support
       or technical assistance directly to Licensee's end users and
       Licensee shall not represent to any of its end users that Tumblr is
       available to provide such support.

       We'll do our best, but we can't guarantee any support for you or your
       Licensed Applications. We also can't support your users. You'll do your
       best to support your own applications.

  7. Content.

    a. Creation of Content. If a Licensee Application allows users to post
       Content (i.e., to generate material that will be hosted on the
       Tumblr Services): (i) Licensee will acquire such user's
       affirmative permission to post such Content, (ii) Licensee must
       promptly provide such Content to Tumblr via the Tumblr Services or
       the Tumblr API, as applicable; (iii) Licensee must provide to its
       users a prominent and clear disclosure detailing how Licensee may
       use such Content separately from transmitting that Content to the
       Tumblr Services and seeking the necessary licenses for Licensee to
       use such Content as disclosed; (iv) Licensee's use of Content
       must adhere to the restrictions set forth in Section 3; (v)
       Licensee must provide such users prominent access via URL to the
       [Tumblr Terms of Service], the [Tumblr Privacy Policy] and the Tumblr
       Content_Policy; and (vi) Licensee may provide Tumblr with an
       application identifier that Tumblr may display in conjunction with
       the Content.

       If your application allows people to post to Tumblr, you need to: get
       their consent, be open with them about their rights and responsibilities
       regarding their content and actually provide that content to Tumblr.

    b. Removal of Content. When Licensee has been notified of such through
       the Tumblr API, Licensee will immediately, and in any case not
       later than twenty-four hours after notification, (including but not
       limited to by modifying applicable Licensee Applications): (i)
       delete or remove Content that has been deleted or removed from the
       Tumblr Services; (ii) modify Content that has been modified on the
       Tumblr Services; and (iii) change Licensee's treatment of
       Content that has had its sharing options modified.

       When bloggers modify or remove content on Tumblr, your application is
       required to reflect those changes.

    c. Storage and Caching of Content. Under no circumstances shall
       Licensee store or cache Content received through the Tumblr API for
       longer than three (3) days; after three (3) days, Licensee shall
       re-request, through the Tumblr API, any such Content from Tumblr.

       Apps cannot cache content for more than three days.

  8. Privacy.

    a. Tumblr User Information. To the extent Licensee has access to and
       is permitted to use Tumblr User Information through the Licensed
       Materials, such access and use shall be in accordance with the
       then-current [Tumblr Privacy Policy]. Licensee shall take efforts to
       ensure that Tumblr User Information disclosed in Content,
       inadvertently or otherwise, is not exploited for improper purposes
       such as identity theft, fraud or spamming.

       We take privacy seriously, and so should you. If you have access to any
       information about a Tumblr user, you have to adhere to our
       [Privacy Policy].

    b. Licensee User Information. Licensee may collect information
       relating to users of Licensee Applications ("Licensee
       Application User Information"). If Licensee collects Licensee
       Application User Information, it shall provide to users an
       applicable privacy policy that clearly discloses Licensee's
       information collection, storage and sharing practices, including
       the extent to which such Licensee Application User Information is
       disclosed to third parties such as Tumblr. Licensee's privacy
       policy must: (i) comply and be consistent with all applicable laws,
       including but not limited to data protection regulations in
       applicable territories; (ii) allow disclosure of Licensee
       Application User Information to Tumblr, to the extent necessary for
       Licensee's use of the Tumblr API and other Licensed Materials, in
       accordance with the then-current [Tumblr PrivacyPolicy]; and (iii) be no
       less protective of applicable end users than the then-current
       [Tumblr Privacy Policy].

       If you are asking users for more information than Tumblr does, you'll have to have
       your own privacy policy that is at least as protective as ours.

  9. Confidentiality. Licensee may from time to time, gain access to
     proprietary information, technical data, trade secrets or know-how,
     including, but not limited to, source code, research, product plans,
     products, services, customers, customer lists, markets, software,
     developments, inventions, processes, formulas, technology, designs,
     drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing,
     finances or other business information that is either marked as
     "confidential" or disclosed in such a manner that it would be
     apparent it should be treated confidentially ("Confidential
     Information"). Licensee may use Confidential Information only to
     the extent necessary to exercise its rights under this Agreement.
     Licensee may not disclose Confidential Information to a third party
     without the prior express consent of Tumblr, provided in writing or by
     email. Licensee agrees that it will protect Confidential Information from
     unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that Licensee
     would use to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of
     a similar nature and in any event with no less than a reasonable degree
     of care.

 10. Term and Termination; Survival. This Agreement shall commence on the
     Effective Date and will remain in effect until terminated pursuant to
     this Section. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, for
     any reason, or for no reason including, but not limited to, if Licensee
     violates any provision of this Agreement. Any termination of this
     Agreement shall also terminate the licenses granted hereunder. Upon
     termination of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee shall cease using,
     and either return to Tumblr, or destroy and remove from all computers,
     hard drives, networks, and other storage media, all copies of the
     Licensed Materials and any Confidential Information in Licensee's
     possession, and shall certify to Tumblr that such actions have occurred.
     Sections 3, 5, 6, 9 and 11-15 shall survive termination of this
     Agreement.

 11. Representations and Warranties of Licensee. Licensee represents and
     warrants that: (i) Licensee has the necessary power and authority to
     enter into this Agreement, and that the performance of its obligations
     will not constitute a breach or otherwise violate any other Agreement or
     the rights of any third party arising therefrom; (ii) Licensee shall
     maintain, throughout the Term, all required rights and licenses related
     to the Licensed Applications and the Licensed Applications shall not
     infringe or otherwise violate any third party rights, including but not
     limited to third party intellectual property rights; and (iii)
     Licensee's uses of the Licensed Materials do and shall comply with
     all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and
     regulations.

 12. Indemnification by Licensee. Licensee will indemnify and hold Tumblr, its
     subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees and agents harmless from
     any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, actions, judgments,
     costs and expenses brought by a third party arising out of or in
     connection with: (i) any act or omission by Licensee in connection with
     Licensee's use of the Tumblr Services or the Licensed Materials;
     (ii) Licensee's use of the Tumblr Services or the Licensed
     Materials other than as expressly allowed by this Agreement; (iii)
     Licensee's breach of this Agreement, including but not limited to
     Licensee's representations and warranties herein; or (iv) any
     Licensed Application.

 13. Disclaimer. The Tumblr Services and the Licensed Materials are provided
     "as is" without warranty of any kind. Tumblr disclaims all
     warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the licensed
     materials and the tumblr services, including without limitation any and
     all implied warranties of merchantability, accuracy, results of use,
     reliability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, interference with
     quiet enjoyment, non-infringement of third-party rights and any
     warranties or conditions arising out of course of dealing or usage of
     trade. Further, Tumblr disclaims any warranty that Licensee's use
     of the Tumblr Services or the Licensed Materials will meet any or all of
     Licensee's requirements or that such use will be uninterrupted,
     error-free, virus-free or secure. Some states do not allow the exclusion
     or limitation of implied warranties, so the above limitations and
     exclusions may not apply to you.

     These two items are especially important. Please make sure you understand
     them.

 14. Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Tumblr be liable to Licensee
     for any special, incidental, indirect, direct, exemplary, punitive,
     compensatory or consequential damages (including loss of use, data,
     business or profits) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
     whether such liability arises from any claim based upon contract,
     warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, and
     whether or not Tumblr has been advised of the possibility of such loss or
     damage. Any claim arising our of or relating to this Agreement must be
     brought within one (1) year. In any case, Tumblr's aggregate
     liability under this Agreement will not exceed fifty U.S. dollars
     (US$50.00). The foregoing limitations will survive and apply even if any
     limited remedy specified in this agreement is found to have failed of its
     essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation
     of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and
     exclusions may not apply to you.

 15. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, the [Tumblr Trademark Guidelines], the
     [Tumblr Content Policy], the [Tumblr Terms of Service] and the [Tumblr Privacy
     Policy] together constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
     respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede and merge
     all prior proposals, understandings and contemporaneous communications,
     whether oral, written or electronic. If any provision of this Agreement
     is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited
     or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will
     otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any
     modification of or changes to this Agreement must be in a writing duly
     authorized by an authorized representative of Tumblr or pursuant to
     Section 4 (Modifications). Licensee may not assign any of the rights or
     obligations granted under this Agreement, voluntarily or by operation of
     law (including without limitation in connection with a merger,
     acquisition, or sale of assets) except with the express written consent
     of Tumblr, and any attempted assignment in violation of this paragraph is
     void. Tumblr may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and
     obligations hereunder without notice or consent. No agency, partnership,
     joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of this
     Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the
     other in any respect. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
     in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its
     conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. Licensee agrees
     that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this
     Agreement shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
     the state and federal courts of New York County, New York. The section
     and paragraph headings in this Agreement, along with all provided
     annotations, are for convenience only and shall not affect the
     interpretation of this Agreement. The failure of Tumblr to enforce any
     part of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of its right to
     later enforce that or any other part of this Agreement. Waiver of
     compliance in any particular instance does not mean that Tumblr will
     waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of any covenant
     or right under this Agreement to be binding, such waiver must be
     memorialized in a writing duly authorized by Tumblr. Unless otherwise
     specified, all notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will
     be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered
     or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when
     receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-
     mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by
     recognized overnight delivery service. All notices to Tumblr shall be
     sent to [legal@tumblr.com]. All notices to Licensee shall be sent to the
     location specified in Licensee's Tumblr API access registration
     information.
