Accepting the Terms of Service

  The purpose of this website, www.tumblr.com (the "Site"), owned and operated
  by Tumblr, Inc. ("Tumblr"), a Delaware corporation, is to provide web
  publishing services. Please read these terms of service ("Agreement")
  carefully before using the Site or any services provided on the Site
  (collectively, "Services"). By using or accessing the Services, you agree to
  become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do
  not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not use the
  Services. The Services are accessed by You ("Subscriber" or "You") under the
  following terms and conditions:

1. Access to the Services

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Tumblr may offer to
  provide the Services, as described more fully on the Site, and which are
  selected by Subscriber, solely for Subscriber’s own use, and not for the
  use or benefit of any third party. Services shall include, but not be
  limited to, any services Tumblr performs for Subscriber, as well as the
  offering of any Content (as defined below) on the Site. Tumblr may change,
  suspend or discontinue the Services at any time, including the availability
  of any feature, database, or Content. Tumblr may also impose limits on
  certain features and services or restrict Subscriber’s access to parts or
  all of the Services without notice or liability. Tumblr reserves the right,
  at its discretion, to modify these Terms of Service at any time by posting
  revised Terms of Service on the Site and by providing notice via e-mail,
  where possible, or on the Site. Subscriber shall be responsible for
  reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Use of the
  Services by Subscriber following such modification constitutes Subscriber's
  acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.

  Subscriber certifies to Tumblr that if Subscriber is an individual (i.e.,
  not a corporate entity), Subscriber is at least 13 years of age. No one
  under the age of 13 may provide any personal information to or on Tumblr
  (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email
  address). Subscriber also certifies that it is legally permitted to use the
  Services and access the Site, and takes full responsibility for the
  selection and use of the Services and access of the Site. This Agreement is
  void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Site is revoked
  in such jurisdictions. Tumblr makes no claim that the Site may be lawfully
  viewed or that Content may be downloaded outside of the United States.
  Access to the Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain
  countries. If You access the Site from outside the United States, You do so
  at Your own risk and You are responsible for compliance with the laws of
  Your jurisdiction.

  Tumblr will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Site and Services are
  available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. However, there will
  be occasions when the Site and/or Services will be interrupted for
  maintenance, upgrades and repairs or due to failure of telecommunications
  links and equipment. Every reasonable step will be taken by Tumblr to
  minimize such disruption where it is within Tumblr’s reasonable control.

  YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER TUMBLR NOR THE SITE WILL BE LIABLE IN ANY EVENT TO
  YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY SUSPENSION, MODIFICATION, DISCONTINUANCE OR
  LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF THE SITE, THE SERVICE, YOUR SUBSCRIBER CONTENT OR
  OTHER CONTENT.

  Tumblr retains the right to create limits on use and storage in its sole
  discretion at any time with or without notice.

  Subscriber shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment
  or ancillary services needed to connect to, access the Site or otherwise
  use the Services, including, without limitation, modems, hardware,
  software, and long distance or local telephone service. Subscriber shall be
  responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are
  compatible with the Services.

2. Site Content

  The Site and its contents are intended solely for the use of Tumblr
  Subscribers and may only be used in accordance with the terms of this
  Agreement. All materials displayed or performed on the Site, including, but
  not limited to text, graphics, logos, tools, photographs, images,
  illustrations, software or source code, audio and video, animations and
  Themes (as defined below), including without limitation the Tumblr Template
  Code (as defined below) (collectively, "Content") (other than Content
  posted by Subscriber ("Subscriber Content")) are the property of Tumblr
  and/or third parties and are protected by United States and international
  copyright laws. The Tumblr API shall be used solely pursuant to the terms
  of the API Terms of Service. All trademarks, service marks, and trade names
  are proprietary to Tumblr and/or third parties. Subscriber shall abide by
  all copyright notices, information, and restrictions contained in any
  Content accessed through the Services.

  The Site is protected by copyright as a collective work and/or compilation,
  pursuant to U.S. copyright laws, international conventions, and other
  copyright laws. Other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
  Subscriber may not copy, modify, publish, transmit, upload, participate in
  the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as provided in this Section),
  create derivative works based on, distribute, perform, display, or in any
  way exploit, any of the Content, software, materials, or Services in whole
  or in part.

  Subscriber may download or copy the Content, and other items displayed on
  the Site for download, for personal use only, provided that Subscriber
  maintains all copyright and other notices contained in such Content.
  Downloading, copying, or storing any Content for other than personal,
  noncommercial use is expressly prohibited without prior written permission
  from Tumblr, or from the copyright holder identified in such Content's
  copyright notice. In the event You download software from the Site, the
  software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the
  software, and the data accompanying the software (collectively, the
  "Software") is licensed to You by Tumblr or third party licensors for Your
  personal, noncommercial use, and no title to the Software shall be
  transferred to You. You may own the Subscriber Content on which the
  Software is recorded, but Tumblr or third party licensors retain full and
  complete title to the Software and all intellectual property rights therein.

3. Subscriber Content

  Subscriber shall own all Subscriber Content that Subscriber contributes to
  the Site, but hereby grants and agrees to grant Tumblr a non-exclusive,
  worldwide, royalty-free, transferable right and license (with the right to
  sublicense), to use, copy, cache, publish, display, distribute, modify,
  create derivative works and store such Subscriber Content and to allow
  others to do so ("Content License") in order to provide the Services. On
  termination of Subscriber’s membership to the Site and use of the Services,
  Tumblr shall make all reasonable efforts to promptly remove from the Site
  and cease use of the Subscriber Content; however, Subscriber recognizes and
  agrees that caching of or references to the Subscriber Content may not be
  immediately removed. Subscriber warrants, represents and agrees Subscriber
  has the right to grant Tumblr and the Site the rights set forth above.
  Subscriber represents, warrants and agrees that it will not contribute any

  secret, unless Subscriber owns the trade secret or has the owner’s
  permission to post it, (c) infringes any intellectual property right of
  another or the privacy or publicity rights of another, (d) is libelous,

  Subscriber Content violates any of sections (a) to (e) of this sentence.
  Tumblr reserves the right to remove any Subscriber Content from the Site,
  suspend or terminate Subscriber’s right to use the Services at any time, or
  pursue any other remedy or relief available to Tumblr and/or the Site under
  equity or law, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt
  of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such
  Subscriber Content or if Tumblr is concerned that Subscriber may have
  breached the immediately preceding sentence), or for no reason at all.

4. Themes

  Tumblr makes available specialized HTML tags ("Tumblr Template Code") for
  the design and layout of blog pages available for use on the Site
  ("Themes"). Certain premium Themes are available for purchase for use on
  Your blog ("Premium Themes"). Tumblr hereby grants You a non-exclusive,
  non-transferable, non-sublicenseable right and license to use and display
  Themes (including Premium Themes) on your blog on the Tumblr Site.
  Purchased Premium Themes may not be transferred between blogs or subscriber
  accounts and are subject to the payment terms herein. You can customize the
  Tumblr Template Code to create your own Themes for use on your blog page
  ("Custom Theme"). If you choose, you may also contribute Your Custom Themes
  to the Site for use by other users. Tumblr hereby grants you a
  non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable right and license to

  Site. You hereby grant and agree to grant Tumblr an exclusive, perpetual,
  sublicensable, irrevocable, royalty-free right and license to use, copy,
  modify, and create derivative works of any Custom Theme contributed by You
  to the Site, including the code and media assets therefor.

5. Meetups

  The Site offers a platform for users to organize and attend face-to-face
  meetings at restaurants, bars and other venues all over the world
  ("Meetups"). However, Tumblr does not sponsor, oversee or in anyway control
  Meetups. You understand and agree that you organize and participate in
  Meetups at your own risk and Tumblr does not bear any responsibility or
  liability for the actions of any Tumblr users or any third parties who
  organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.

  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, TUMBLR DISCLAIMS ALL
  LIABILITY, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF
  OTHER TUMBLR USERS OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
  DAMAGES, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL AND/OR CONSEQUENTIAL ARISING OUT OF
  YOUR ORGANIZATION OR ATTENDANCE AT A MEETUP OR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH ANY
  TUMBLR USER OR THIRD PARTY YOU MEET AT SUCH EVENTS.

6. Restrictions

  Subscriber is responsible for all of its activity in connection with the
  Services and accessing the Site. Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise
  illegal activity or any use of the Services or Content in violation of this
  Agreement may be grounds for termination of Subscriber’s right to Services
  or to access the Site. Subscriber may not post or transmit, or cause to be
  posted or transmitted, any communication or solicitation designed or
  intended to obtain password, account, or private information from any
  Tumblr user.

  network, crack passwords or security encryption codes, transfer or store
  illegal material including that are deemed threatening or obscene, or

  circumstances will Subscriber use the Site or the Service to (a) send
  unsolicited e-mails, bulk mail, spam or other materials to users of the
  Site or any other individual, (b) harass, threaten, stalk or abuse any
  person or party, including other users of the Site, (c) create a false
  identity or to impersonate another person, or (d) post any false,
  inaccurate or incomplete material or delete or revise any material that was

7. Warranty disclaimer

  Tumblr has no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to Subscriber.
  Subscriber acknowledges that Tumblr has no control over, and no duty to
  take any action regarding: which users gains access to the Site; which
  Content Subscriber accesses via the Site; what effects the Content may have
  on Subscriber; how Subscriber may interpret or use the Content; or what
  actions Subscriber may take as a result of having been exposed to the
  Content. Much of the Content of the Site is provided by and is the
  responsibility of the user or subscriber who posted the Content. Tumblr
  does not monitor the Content of the Site and takes no responsibility for
  such Content. Subscriber releases Tumblr from all liability for Subscriber
  having acquired or not acquired Content through the Site. The Site may
  contain, or direct Subscriber to sites containing, information that some
  people may find offensive or inappropriate. Tumblr makes no representations
  concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Site, and
  Tumblr will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright
  compliance, legality or decency of material contained in or accessed
  through the Site.

  ALTHOUGH TUMBLR AND THE SITE WILL MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO STORE AND
  PRESERVE THE MATERIAL RESIDING ON THE SITE, NEITHER TUMBLR NOR THE SITE IS
  RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR THE FAILURE TO STORE, PRESERVE OR
  ACCESS SUBSCRIBER CONTENT OR OTHER MATERIALS YOU TRANSMIT OR ARCHIVE ON THE
  SITE. YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED TO TAKE MEASURES TO PRESERVE COPIES OF ANY
  DATA, MATERIAL, CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST OR UPLOAD ON THE SITE. YOU
  ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING BACK-UPS OF YOUR SUBSCRIBER CONTENT.

  THE SERVICES, CONTENT, SITE AND ANY SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
  BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. TUMBLR MAKES NO
  REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE, THE

  LIMITATION, HARM CAUSED BY VIRUSES, WORMS, TROJAN HORSES, OR ANY SIMILAR
  CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE PROGRAM.

  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS,
  SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO SUBSCRIBER.

8. Third party websites

  Users of the Site may gain access from the Site to third party sites on the
  Internet through hypertext or other computer links on the Site. Third party
  sites are not within the supervision or control of Tumblr or the Site.
  Unless explicitly otherwise provided, neither Tumblr nor the Site make any
  representation or warranty whatsoever about any third party site that is
  linked to the Site, or endorse the products or services offered on such
  site. Tumblr and the Site disclaim: (a) all responsibility and liability
  for content on third party websites and (b) any representations or
  warranties as to the security of any information (including, without
  limitation, credit card and other personal information) You might be
  requested to give any third party, and You hereby irrevocably waive any
  claim against the Site or Tumblr with respect to such sites and third party
  content.

9. Registration and security

  As a condition to using Services, Subscriber will be required to register
  with Tumblr and select a password and Tumblr URL. Subscriber shall provide
  Tumblr with accurate, complete, and updated registration information,
  including Subscriber’s e-mail address. Failure to do so shall constitute a
  breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of
  Subscriber's account. Subscriber may not (a) select or use as a Tumblr URL
  a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (b)
  use as a Tumblr URL a name subject to any rights of a person other than
  Subscriber without appropriate authorization. Tumblr reserves the right to
  refuse registration of, or cancel a Tumblr URL in its discretion.
  Subscriber shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
  Subscriber's Tumblr password. Subscriber is solely responsible for any use
  of or action taken under Subscriber’s password and accepts full
  responsibility for all activity conducted through Subscriber’s account and
  agrees to and hereby releases the Site and Tumblr from any and all
  liability concerning such activity. Subscriber agrees to notify Tumblr
  immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of
  Subscriber’s account or password. The Site will take reasonable security
  precautions when using the internet, telephone or other means to transport
  data or other communications, but expressly disclaims any and all liability
  for the accessing of any such data communications by unauthorized persons
  or entities.

10. Indemnity

  Subscriber will indemnify and hold Tumblr, its directors, officers and
  employees, harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any claim or
  demand made by any third party due to or arising out of Subscriber’s access
  to the Site, use of the Services, the violation of this Agreement by
  Subscriber, or the infringement by Subscriber, or any third party using the
  Subscriber's account, of any intellectual property or other right of any
  person or entity.

11. Limitation of liability

  IN NO EVENT SHALL TUMBLR, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES
  OR MEMBERS BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE OR THE SERVICES FOR (A) ANY
  INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
  WHATSOEVER; (B) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE, PROFITS, DATA, IMAGES, SUBSCRIBER
  CONTENT OR OTHER INTANGIBLES; (C) DAMAGES FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE,
  NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE SITE, ERRORS OR OMISSIONS; OR (D) DAMAGES RELATED TO
  DOWNLOADING OR POSTING CONTENT. TUMBLR'S AND THE SITE'S COLLECTIVE
  LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THREE HUNDRED UNITED
  STATES DOLLARS. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND
  EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO SUBSCRIBER.

12. Fees and payment

  Some of the Services require payment of fees. All fees are stated in U.S.
  dollars. Subscriber shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Site
  in connection with such Services selected by Subscriber, and any related
  taxes or additional charges. All fees are non-refundable unless expressly
  stated otherwise on the Site. Subscriber represents to Tumblr that
  Subscriber is the authorized account holder or an authorized user of the
  chosen method of payment used to pay for the paid aspects of the Services.
  All fee-based Services and virtual goods are provided "AS IS" with no
  warranties of any kind. Tumblr may modify and/or eliminate such fee-based
  Services at its discretion. Subscriber understands and agrees that the
  payment for virtual goods grants Subscriber a limited license to use the
  virtual goods as specified on the Site.

  Tumblr may change its prices at any time but will provide you reasonable
  notice of any such changes by posting the new prices on the Site and by
  sending you email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices,
  you may cancel the services prior to the change going into effect.

13. Termination

  Either party may terminate the Services at any time by notifying the other
  party by any means. Tumblr may also terminate or suspend any and all
  Services and access to the Site immediately, without prior notice or
  liability, if Subscriber breaches any of the terms or conditions of this
  Agreement. Upon termination of Subscriber's account, Subscriber’s right to
  use the Services, access the Site, and any Content will immediately cease.
  All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive
  termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation,
  ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
  Termination of Your access to and use of the Site and the Services shall
  not relieve Subscriber of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such
  termination or limit any liability which Subscriber otherwise may have to
  Tumblr or the Site, including without limitation any indemnification
  obligations contained herein.

14. Privacy

  Please review our Privacy Policy, which governs the use of personal
  information on the Site and to which Subscriber agrees to be bound as a
  user of the Site.

15. Miscellaneous

  This Agreement (including the Privacy Policy), as modified from time to
  time, constitutes the entire agreement between You, the Site and Tumblr
  with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement replaces all
  prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral,
  regarding the subject matter hereof. The failure of either party to
  exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a
  waiver of any further rights hereunder. Tumblr shall not be liable for any
  failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results
  from any cause beyond Tumblr’s reasonable control, including, without
  limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or
  degradation. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be
  unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to
  the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain
  in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable,
  transferable or sublicensable by Subscriber except with Tumblr’s prior
  written consent. Tumblr may assign this Agreement in whole or in part at
  any time without Subscriber’s consent. This Agreement shall be governed by
  and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware without
  regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. No agency, partnership,
  joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and
  Subscriber does not have any authority of any kind to bind Tumblr in any
  respect whatsoever. Any notice to the Site that is required or permitted by
  this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon
  receipt, when sent by confirmed e-mail to support@tumblr.com or when
  delivered in person by nationally recognized overnight courier or mailed by
  first class, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to Tumblr,
  Inc., 35 East 21st Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY, 10010, Attn: Legal Dept.

16. Copyright Policy

  Tumblr has adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement with
  respect to the Site in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright
  Act, a copy of which is located at
  [http://www.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf]. The address of Tumblr's
  Designated Agent for copyright takedown notices ("Designated Agent") is
  listed below.

  Reporting Copyright Infringements

    If You believe that content residing or accessible on the Site infringes a
    copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the
    following information to the Designated Agent at the address below:

      1. Identification of the work or material being infringed.

      2. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing,
         including its location, with sufficient detail so that Tumblr is
         capable of finding and verifying its existence.

      3. Contact information about the notifying party (the Notifying Party),
         including name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.

      4. A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the
         material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law.

      5. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information
         provided in the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is
         authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.

      6. The Notifying Party's physical or electronic signature.

    After the Designated Agent receives notification of an alleged
    infringement that meets all of the requirements above, Tumblr shall:

      1. Disable access to or remove material that it has a reasonable, good
         faith belief is copyrighted material that has been illegally copied
         and distributed by any subscriber to the Site.

      2. Tumblr will then immediately notify the subscriber responsible for
         the allegedly infringing material (the Offending Subscriber) that it
         has removed or disabled access to the material.

      3. Tumblr reserves the right, at its discretion, to immediately
         terminate the account of any subscriber who is the subject of
         repeated takedown notices.

  Filing Copyright Counterclaims

    A subscriber who believes they are the wrongful subject of a copyright
    takedown notice, may file a counter notification with Tumblr, by providing
    the following items in writing to the Designated Agent at the address
    below:

      • The specific URLs of material that Tumblr has removed or to which
        Tumblr has disabled access.

      • User’s name, address, telephone number, and email address.

      • A statement that User consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District
        Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or
        New York County, New York if your address is outside of the United
        States), and that User will accept service of process from the person
        who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of
        such person.

      • The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I
        have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as
        a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be
        removed or disabled."

      • User’s signature.

    Upon receipt of a counterclaim, Tumblr will forward it to the party who
    submitted the original copyright infringement claim. The original
    complainant will then have 10 days to notify us that he or she has filed
    legal action relating to the allegedly infringing material. If Tumblr does
    not receive any such notification within 10 days, we may restore the
    material to the Site.
